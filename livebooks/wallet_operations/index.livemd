# Manual Bitcoin Management Example

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:bitcoinlib, "~> 0.2.3"}
])

alias BitcoinLib.Key.{PrivateKey, PublicKey, PublicKeyHash, Address}
alias BitcoinLib.Key.HD.SeedPhrase
alias BitcoinLib.Transaction
alias BitcoinLib.Script
```

## Keys creation

🎲 Create a seed phrase from dice rolls.

To do so, just throw 50 dice, and make a string of 50 chars containing the results, so it can be converted into a 12 words `seed phrase`.

```elixir
{:ok, seed_phrase} =
  SeedPhrase.from_dice_rolls("12345612345612345612345612345612345612345612345612")

seed_phrase = "rally celery split order almost twenty ignore record legend learn chaos decade"
```

🔑 Derive the `master private key` from the seed phrase.

```elixir
master_private_key = PrivateKey.from_seed_phrase(seed_phrase)
```

Derive the receive `private key` and extract a P2PKH `public key hash` that will be useful later.

To keep things simple, just know that it's the `44'` in the derivation path that makes it a `P2PKH` transaction. This is a bit outside of the exercise's scope, so let's continue.

```elixir
receive_private_key =
  master_private_key
  |> PrivateKey.from_derivation_path!("m/44'/1'/0'/1/3")

receive_public_key_hash =
  receive_private_key
  |> PublicKey.from_private_key()
  |> PublicKeyHash.from_public_key()
```

Convert the `public key hash` to an `address`, which will be needed by faucets to receive funds

```elixir
receive_address = Address.from_public_key_hash(receive_public_key_hash, :p2pkh, :testnet)
```

## Request some funds

### 👁️ Monitor the address

Go to `mempool.space` by directly forging the URL with the address and wait transactions being confirmed.

Ex: `https://mempool.space/testnet/address/mwuh4ikLxAqQfSBEYVDiwdrfEVBKw8h98x`

Now leave that browser tab lying around. Mempool is supposed to issue a cashier bell sound 🔔 when it detects new incoming transactions to that address. When funds become spendable, you'll also hear somewhat of a magic wand sound. 🪄

### 🚰 Request some testnet Bitcoin from faucets

Go to a Bitcoin Testnet faucet and use the above address to request funds... any amount would do, even tiny fractions.

* [https://coinfaucet.eu/en/btc-testnet/](coinfaucet)
* [https://bitcoinfaucet.uo1.net/](uo1.net)
* [https://testnet.qc.to/](qc.to)
* [https://onchain.io/bitcoin-testnet-faucet](onchain.io)

Here is an example of 10000 testnet sats, or 0.0001 tBTC, being ready to spend with 14 confirmations.

## Examine transactions

Click on the transaction ID.

There is a `Inputs & Outputs` section, with inputs on the left and outputs in the right... here, our address is the first output. In computer science, `0` represents the first value, and we associate it to `vout`. This will be useful later to point to the right output inside the transaction, which happens to have two here.

Clicking on the `Details` button reveals this:

![transaction details](images/transaction_details.png)

Here lies the `script pub key`, also known as the `locking script`. This is what prevents funds from being spent, unless it is being used with the right parameters. That is exactly what's going to happen later.

The following code is defining variables containing what we just talked about.

```elixir
transaction_id = "ba9e74b6359c5ff49bb5a1dc0979ce85db8ee45aa90fbf170ff72dec0aad542f"
vout = 0
script_pub_key = "76a9140afcad5c79123211ad61bd4723e1b23e9480f1c788ac"
```

## Extract parameters

The above `script pub key` is locking what we call a UTXO which stands for Unspent Transaction Output. The sum of all UTXOs in a wallet is what can be considered as the balance.

Spending from a UTXO invalidates it, creating new ones in the process.

The current UTXO contains `10000` sats. We intend to send `5000` sats to a new address. This leaves `5000` sats remaining. They must end up in two other destinations: `the change` and `the transaction fee`. The change is another UTXO and we'll keep `4000` sats. The fee is what's leftover and the miner who will include the transaction in a new block will keep it. It is thus implied from the three previous amounts:

```elixir
original_amount = 3_670_000
destination_amount = 10000
change_amount = 3_657_000
fee = original_amount - destination_amount - change_amount
```

Let's create two public key hashes: a `destination` and a `change`.

```elixir
destination_public_key_hash =
  master_private_key
  |> PrivateKey.from_derivation_path!("m/44'/1'/0'/0/6")
  |> PublicKey.from_private_key()
  |> PublicKeyHash.from_public_key()
```

```elixir
change_public_key_hash =
  master_private_key
  |> PrivateKey.from_derivation_path!("m/44'/1'/0'/1/4")
  |> PublicKey.from_private_key()
  |> PublicKeyHash.from_public_key()
```

## Create a transaction

Now we've got everything we need to create a new transaction and sign it. Let's kill two birds in one shot. The following code will create a transaction specification and sign it with the help of the private key.

```elixir
%Transaction.Spec{}
|> Transaction.Spec.add_input(
  txid: transaction_id,
  vout: vout,
  redeem_script: script_pub_key
)
|> Transaction.Spec.add_output(
  Script.Types.P2pkh.create(destination_public_key_hash),
  destination_amount
)
|> Transaction.Spec.add_output(
  Script.Types.P2pkh.create(change_public_key_hash),
  change_amount
)
|> Transaction.Spec.sign_and_encode(receive_private_key)
```

## Move funds

Now that we've got an encoded transaction, it is time to include it in the blockchain. To do so, we can use `mempool.space` again by inserting it in this form: [https://mempool.space/testnet/tx/push](https://mempool.space/testnet/tx/push).

In the present context, it returned `05517750a78fb8c38346b1bf5908d71abe728811b643105be6595e11a9392373`. This is the transaction that spends the fund and can be seen on the [transaction explorer](https://mempool.space/testnet/tx/05517750a78fb8c38346b1bf5908d71abe728811b643105be6595e11a9392373)

## Conclusion

From now on, the previous 10000 sats transaction is considered as spent and can no longer be called a UTXO. Two new ones have been created:

* The destination containing 5000 sats
* The change containing 4000 sats

The remaining 1000 sats have been donated to the miner. It can be seen on `mempool.space` in the header of the transaction screen.
